## 3 Key Tips to Turn Data into Campaign Gold

### 1. Define Your Goals

What are you trying to achieve? 
- Brand awareness?
- Website traffic?
- Lead generation?
- Sales conversions?

Knowing your goals helps you identify the right data points to track. Without clear objectives, you'll drown in data without actionable insights.

Make your data compelling and memorable, not just accurate.
